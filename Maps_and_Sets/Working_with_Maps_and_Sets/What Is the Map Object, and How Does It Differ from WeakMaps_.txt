In JavaScript, a Map is a built-in object that stores key-value pairs, similar to an object. However, it differs from standard JavaScript objects by allowing keys of any type, including objects and functions.

A WeakMap is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a Map, but it uses weak references for its keys. The keys must be objects, while the values can be of any type.

Think of the relationship between a WeakMap and a Map as similar to the relationship between a WeakSet and a Set, as you learned in the previous lesson.

To create a Map, you use the Map() constructor prepended with the new keyword:

const myFirstMap = new Map();
You can initialize the Map with values:

const myTreesMap = new Map([
 [{ type: 'deciduous' }, 'Maple tree'],
 [['forest', 'grove'], 'Pine tree'],
 [42, 'Oak tree'],
 [true, 'Birch tree'],
 [function() { return 'I am a function key'; }, 'Willow tree'],
]);
If you didn't initialize the Map with values, you can use the set() method to add them:

const myTreesMap = new Map();
myTreesMap.set({ type: 'deciduous' }, 'Maple tree');
myTreesMap.set([1, 2], 'Pine tree');
myTreesMap.set(42, 'Oak tree');
myTreesMap.set(true, 'Birch tree');
myTreesMap.set(function() { return "I'm a function key"; }, 'Willow tree');

console.log(myTreesMap);
Here's what a Map looks like in the console:

/*
Map(5) {{…} => 'Maple tree', Array(2) => 'Pine tree', 42 => 'Oak tree', true => 'Birch tree', ƒ => 'Willow tree'}
  [[Entries]]
    0:{Object => "Maple tree"}
      key: {type: 'deciduous'}
      value: "Maple tree"
    1:{Array(2) => "Pine tree"}
      key: (2)
      value: "Pine tree"
    2:{42 => "Oak tree"}
      key: 42
      value: "Oak tree"
    3:{true => "Birch tree"}
      key: true
      value: "Birch tree"
    4:{function () { return "I'm a function key"; } => "Willow tree"}
      key: f ()
      value: "Willow tree"
    size: 5
    [[Prototype]]: Map
*/
Other methods you can use to work with a Map are:

get(key) to retrieve the value associated with the specified key.
has(key) to check if a key exists in the Map.
delete(key) to remove a key-value pair from the Map.
clear() to remove all key-value pairs.
entries() to check the entries of the Map (it returns the entries in a MapIterator).
forEach() to loop through the entries of the Map.
size to indicate the number of key-value pairs in the Map.
There's a WeakMap() constructor you can use to create a WeakMap:

const myFirstWeakMap = new WeakMap();
The set(), get(), has(), and delete() methods are all available for use with a WeakMap as well. For example here's how you can assign items to the Map with the set() method:

const myTreeWeakMap = new WeakMap();

myTreeWeakMap.set({ id: 1 }, 'Maple tree');
myTreeWeakMap.set({ id: 2 }, 'Pine tree');
myTreeWeakMap.set({ id: 3 }, 'Oak tree');
myTreeWeakMap.set({ id: 4 }, 'Birch tree');
myTreeWeakMap.set({ id: 5 }, 'Willow tree');

console.log(myTreeWeakMap);
Here's what a WeakMap looks like in the console:

/*
WeakMap {{…} => 'Willow tree', {…} => 'Maple tree', {…} => 'Pine tree', {…} => 'Oak tree'}
  [[Entries]]
    No properties
  [[Prototype]]: WeakMap
*/
Here are the differences between a Map and a WeakMap:

Feature	Map	WeakMap
Key Type	Keys can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, objects, or even functions.	Keys must be objects.
Use Case	Use a Map when you need to associate data with any type of key.	Use a WeakMap when you only need to associate data with objects.
Iteration	You can loop through a Map using forEach(), keys(), values(), or entries().	A WeakMap is not iterable.
Size Property	Map has a size property to get the number of key-value pairs.	WeakMap does not have a size property.
In the table above, you can see the differences summarized including the key type, use case, iteration and size property. Please take a moment to read the content of this table to learn more about their differences.
