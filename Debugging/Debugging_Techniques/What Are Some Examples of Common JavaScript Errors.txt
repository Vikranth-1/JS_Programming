As you've been programming in JavaScript, you've inevitably run into error messages. Understanding common error messages will help you debug more effectively and develop into a stronger programmer. The four common types of error messages are SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError, and RangeError.

A SyntaxError happens when you write something incorrectly in your code, like missing a parenthesis, or a bracket. Think of it like a grammar mistake in a sentence. Here is a common mistake developers make when creating arrays:

const arr = ["Beau", "Quincy" "Tom"]
Each array element needs to be separated by a comma otherwise it will result in an error message.

The second common JavaScript error is a ReferenceError. There are several types of ReferenceErrors, triggered in different ways. The first type of ReferenceError would be not defined variables.

console.log(price);
In this example, we are trying to log the price variable to the console but it hasn’t been defined. This is will result in a ReferenceError.

Another example of a ReferenceError is trying to access a variable, declared with let or const, before it has been defined:

console.log(b);
const b = 50;
The example above will result in a Cannot access 'b' before initialization error.

The third common error would be a TypeError. These errors occur when you try to perform an operation on the wrong type. Here is an example of trying to use the map method on an object:

const developerObj = {
  name: "Jessica",
  country: "USA",
  isEmployed: true
};

developerObj.map()
This example will result in a developerObj.map is not a function error because the map method is used for arrays and not objects.

The last common error we will look at is the RangeError.

A RangeError happens when your code tries to use a value that’s outside the range of what JavaScript can handle. Here is an example of assigning an invalid value to an array's length:

const arr = [];
arr.length = -1; 
Since an array's length has to be a non-negative integer, setting it to -1 triggers a RangeError.

As you continue to program in JavaScript, just be aware of these different types of errors you will probably encounter and why they are happening.
