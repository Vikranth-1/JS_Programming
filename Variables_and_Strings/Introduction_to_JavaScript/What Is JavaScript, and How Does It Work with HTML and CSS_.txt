JavaScript is a powerful programming language that brings interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

While HTML and CSS are markup languages used to structure content and style elements on a page, JavaScript goes beyond those by enabling more complex functionality, such as handling user input, animating elements, and even building full web applications.

For example, when you click a button, submit a form, or hover over a menu, JavaScript determines how the page behaves.

Here's an example of how these three work together:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click me</button>
</body>
</html>
In this example, HTML is used to define the content: a heading (an h1 element) and a button (the button element).

CSS is used to apply styles to the heading, such as making the text green. JavaScript is used to display an alert message when the button is clicked.

To sum up, HTML provides structure, CSS adds styling, and JavaScript enables behavior, creating a complete and interactive web experience.
