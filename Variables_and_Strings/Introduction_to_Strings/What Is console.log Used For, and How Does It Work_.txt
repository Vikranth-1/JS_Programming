The prior lessons introduced you to console.log() but this lesson will dive deeper into its purpose and usage.

In JavaScript, console.log() is a simple yet powerful tool used to display messages or output information to the browser's console. It's mostly used by developers to debug and inspect code while working on their programs.

You can use console.log() to log text or variables to the console and ensure your code is running correctly.

To use console.log(), you call the method with the value or message you want to output inside the parentheses. Here are some examples:

console.log("Hello, world!");

let num = 5;
console.log(num); // 5
The first example prints Hello, world! in the browser's console, while the second example prints the value 5.

Here is another example of working with console.log():

let name = "Alice";
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!"); // Hello, Alice!
You can also pass in multiple values to console.log() separated by commas. For example:

let name = "Alice";
let age = 25;
console.log("Name:", name, "Age:", age); // Name: Alice Age: 25
This is helpful for logging multiple pieces of information at once.

The console.log() method helps you monitor your code as it runs, making it easier to spot mistakes and understand how your program behaves.
