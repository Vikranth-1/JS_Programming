In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text data. Strings are one of the primitive data types in the language, along with numbers, booleans, null, and undefined.

To create a string in JavaScript, you can use single quotes ('), or double quotes (").

Here is an example of creating two variables that hold string values:

let singleQuotes = 'This is a string';
console.log(singleQuotes);
let doubleQuotes = "This is also a string";
console.log(doubleQuotes);
Even though you can use single or double quotes to create strings, it's important to be consistent. If a string begins with a single quote, it must also end with a single quote.

The same applies to double quotes. The following example will throw an error because it starts with a double quote and ends with a single quote:

const improperStr = "Do not do this';
Another thing to take into account is that strings are immutable. In programming, immutability means that once something is created, it cannot be changed. So, when you create a string, you can't change its characters directly. Instead, you would create a new string if you want to make changes.

Here is an example of assigning a new string to a developer variable:

let developer = "Jessica";
console.log(developer);
developer = "Quincy";
console.log(developer);
Since strings are immutable, we can't update the first string directly. That is why we are assigning a new string to the developer variable.

Strings are an important part of programming, and in future lessons, you will learn advanced techniques for manipulating them and harnessing their full potential to create dynamic and interactive applications.
