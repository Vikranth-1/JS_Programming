The change event is a special event which is fired when the user modifies the value of certain input elements. More specifically:

When a checkbox is ticked or unticked.

When a radio button is ticked.

When the user makes a selection from something like a date picker or dropdown menu.

When an input loses focus (the user tabs to the next field, or clicks out of the form) after the user has changed the value.

When the user otherwise confirms the value, such as by hitting enter after typing some text.

Note that the change event does NOT fire when your user types in an input. The change event will only fire after they have focused on another element.

Here is an example of using the change event with a dropdown menu:

<select id="select-menu">
  <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
  <option value="option3">Option 3</option>
</select>
<script src="index.js"></script>
const selectMenu = document.getElementById("select-menu");
selectMenu.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
  console.log(`You selected: ${event.target.value}`);
});
Each time the user selects a different option from the dropdown menu, the change event will fire, and the selected value will be logged to the console.

The change event still generates an Event object, but unlike most other events it does not generate a custom implementation – the only properties and methods you will have access to are those on the base Event object.

This differs from the input event, which generates a dedicated InputEvent object. The change event also differs in a few ways. An input event WILL trigger when a user types content into a field, for example.

These differences are important to remember, as you might get tripped up by the timing of these events firing.
