When building your programs, you'll often want something to happen after a delay, or repeat at regular intervals. That's where the setTimeout() and setInterval() methods come in handy. Both methods accept two parameters: a function and a delay.

Let's look at each of the methods in more detail so you can start using them in your web projects. 

setTimeout() lets you delay an action for a specified time. Here's the basic syntax of the setTimeout() method:

setTimeout(functionToRun, delay);
functionToRun is the code you want to execute after a specified delay, and delay is the time (in milliseconds) to wait before running the function. Here's an example:

setTimeout(function () {
 console.log("This runs after 3 seconds");
}, 3000);
You can also use an arrow function for the callback, like this:

setTimeout(() => {
 console.log("This runs after 3 seconds"); 
}, 3000);
setInterval() keeps repeating a function at a set interval. It's like having an alarm that goes off every few seconds. setInterval() is perfect when you want something to happen over and over again, like refreshing data or creating an animation that moves continuously.

Just like setTimeout(), it takes a function and a delay:

setInterval(functionToRun, delay);
functionToRun is the code you want to run repeatedly, while delay is the time in milliseconds between each execution of that function. Here's an example:

setInterval(() => {
 console.log("This runs every 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

// Result:
// This runs every 2 seconds
// This runs every 2 seconds
// This runs every 2 seconds
// ...
Since setInterval() keeps executing the provided function at the specified interval, you might want to stop it. To do this, you have to use the clearInterval() method.

To do the work, clearInterval() takes the ID of the setInterval() you want to stop. This could be a variable you assign the interval to. One way to stop the interval is inside a setTimeout(), as that will stop the interval after a certain time:

const intervalID = setInterval(() => {
 console.log("This will stop after 5 seconds");
}, 1000);

setTimeout(() => {
 clearInterval(intervalID);
}, 5000);
You can also stop a timeout with the clearTimeout() method:

let timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
 console.log("This will not run");
}, 5000);

clearTimeout(timeoutID);
With that code, the setTimeout() will not run at all. So, a more elegant way to do it is through the DOM, by adding a click event listener to a button to stop the timeout:

<h1>Cancel Timeout Example</h1>
<button id="cancelButton">Cancel Timeout</button>
<script src="index.js"></script>
let timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This will run if not canceled");
}, 5000);

document
.querySelector("#cancelButton")
.addEventListener("click", () => {
  clearTimeout(timeoutID);
  console.log("Timeout canceled!");
});
