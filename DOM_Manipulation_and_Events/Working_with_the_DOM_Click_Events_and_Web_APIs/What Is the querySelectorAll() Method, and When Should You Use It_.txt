Let's learn about the querySelectorAll() method. You can use this method to get a list of all the DOM elements that match a specific CSS selector.

This is how you can call the querySelectorAll() method:

document.querySelectorAll(selectors);
Call it on the document object and pass a string with the CSS selectors as an argument. The argument must be a valid CSS selector string. Otherwise, a SyntaxError exception will be thrown.

querySelectorAll() returns a NodeList object, a collection of nodes that match the specified CSS selector.

The list will contain one Element object for each element that matches the CSS selectors. If no matches are found, the list will be empty.

The elements will be in the order in which they appear in the HTML document. For example, you can match all elements of a specific type:

document.querySelectorAll("div");
All elements with a specific class:

document.querySelectorAll(".rounded");
All elements with a specific ID:

document.querySelectorAll("#logo");
Or all elements with a specific attribute, like all links that take users to a specific URL:

document.querySelectorAll("a[href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/']");
You can also use more complex CSS selectors, like this one, which matches all list items within an unordered list element with the class ingredients:

document.querySelectorAll("ul.ingredients li");
Since the method will return a collection of nodes, you can assign this collection to a variable and use it in your programs to work with the individual elements, like you can see in this example with the general syntax:

const matches = document.querySelectorAll(selectors); 
For example, if you have this unordered list with three list items:

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>Flour</li>
  <li>Cheese</li>
  <li>Water</li>
</ul>
You can call the querySelectorAll() method to match all list items within the unordered list with the class ingredients and assign the return value to the matches constant:

const matches = document.querySelectorAll("ul.ingredients li");
This will return a collection of three nodes. Each node represents a list item element:

// NodeList(3)
{
  0: `<li>Flour</li>`,
  1: `<li>Cheese</li>`,
  2: `<li>Water</li>`,
  length: 3,
}
You can work with this collection exactly like you would work with any other JavaScript array.

For example, you can show it in the console with console.log():

console.log(matches);
You can also check the length of the collection with the length property:

console.log(matches.length);
The output will be an integer representing the number of nodes in the collection:

3
You can also access the individual elements of the collection with their corresponding indices. The first element will be at index 0:

console.log(matches[0]);
console.log(matches[1]);
console.log(matches[2]);
This is the output:

<li>Flour</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
<li>Water</li>
The elements are printed one by one on the console.

You can also iterate over the elements with a for loop:

for (let i = 0; i < matches.length; i++) {
  console.log(matches[i]);    
}
The output will be exactly the same in this case. But this can be very powerful for working with all the elements of the collection.

The querySelectorAll() method in JavaScript is a powerful tool for selecting multiple elements based on their CSS selectors. With this method, you can select specific elements within your web pages and manipulate them as needed.
