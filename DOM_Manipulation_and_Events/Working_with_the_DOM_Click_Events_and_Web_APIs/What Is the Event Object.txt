The Event object is a payload that triggers when a user interacts with your web page in some way. These interactions can be anything from clicking on a button or focusing an input to shaking their mobile device.

Like all JavaScript objects, the Event object has a number of properties that might be helpful. The properties available depend on the event that triggered this payload.

All Event objects will have the type property. This property reveals the type of event that triggered the payload, such as "keydown" or "click". These values will correspond to the same values you might pass to addEventListener(), where you can capture and utilize the Event object.

Event objects will always have the target property. The target property is a reference to whatever object triggered the event. Most commonly, this will be some sort of HTMLElement object, or the Document or Window objects. But it can also be something more specific, like an AudioContext.

Events also have methods, which are functions exposed as properties on the object. One commonly used method is preventDefault(), which prevents the default behavior of the event when called.

If you want to handle form submissions yourself, for example, you might call preventDefault() to keep the browser from trying to submit the form data as a POST request. You will learn more about POST requests in future lessons.

You'll also likely run in to the stopPropagation() method. This method prevents the event from bubbling up or propagating to parent elements. You'll learn more about what this means in a future lesson.

There are also a large number of properties that are specific to certain implementations of the Event object. For example, a FetchEvent will have a request property to contain the request that triggered the event.

If you are ever unsure of what properties are available, you can log the Event object in question or even check the documentation.
