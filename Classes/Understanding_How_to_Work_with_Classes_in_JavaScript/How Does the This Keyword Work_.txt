You learned that classes are like blueprints that you can use to create objects.

These blueprints need a general way to refer to the specific object that is being created, accessed, or modified within the code. That's exactly what the this keyword is used for. It refers to the context where the code is supposed to run. If you use it within a method, the value of this will be a reference to the object associated to that method. This way, you can access the properties and methods of the object within the class and reuse the method on different objects.

For example, here we have a Dessert class. This time, we're defining a hasPeanuts property.

class Dessert {
  constructor(hasPeanuts) {
    this.hasPeanuts = hasPeanuts;
  }
}
Notice that we're using the this keyword within the constructor. Remember that the constructor is called automatically when a new object of the class is created.

The this keyword is telling the program that hasPeanuts should be a property of the object that is currently being created.

The right-hand side of the assignment statement is assigning the value of the hasPeanuts parameter to the hasPeanuts property of the new object.

this.hasPeanuts = hasPeanuts;
That's in the context of the constructor but you can also use the this keyword within other methods.

This is our Dessert class with a few changes. Now we have two properties: name and price.

class Dessert {
  constructor(name, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }

  showPrice() {
    console.log(`The price of ${this.name} is $${this.price}.`);
  }
}
We also have a new showPrice method. In this method, we print a descriptive message to the console with the name and the price of the dessert object.

Notice how we're using the this keyword to access the properties of the object within the showPrice method.

What value will the this keyword have in the context of this method? It will refer to the object on which the method is being called. In this case, we're creating a new Dessert instance with the name "Brownie" and the price $5.99:

const brownie = new Dessert("Brownie", 5.99);
If we call the .showPrice() method on this object:

brownie.showPrice();
Here is the full example:

class Dessert {
  constructor(name, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }

  showPrice() {
    console.log(`The price of ${this.name} is $${this.price}.`);
  }
}

const brownie = new Dessert("Brownie", 5.99);
brownie.showPrice();
console.log(brownie);
The name and price of the current object (brownie) are replaced in the string.

This is all thanks to the this keyword, which gives you a general way to refer to the current object within the class. This allows you to reuse the method on different objects.

This is in the context of object methods but the this keyword will also have a value in standalone functions and arrow functions.

Its value within a standalone function typically refers to the global object (in non-strict mode) or undefined (in strict mode).

The value of the this keyword is a bit different in arrow functions. Arrow functions inherit the value of this from the enclosing scope where they are defined. They don't create their own this binding. That means that the value of this depends on the context where the arrow function is defined, not where or how the arrow function is called. This makes arrow functions helpful for callbacks or for preserving context.

However, because of this, the value of this will not refer to the current object in object methods, so this is something that you should keep in mind when working with arrow functions.

The same applies to arrow functions defined within other functions. They will inherit the value of this from their parent scope.

The this keyword is a powerful tool for accessing and manipulating objects. Understanding how it works is essential for mastering object-oriented programming in JavaScript.
