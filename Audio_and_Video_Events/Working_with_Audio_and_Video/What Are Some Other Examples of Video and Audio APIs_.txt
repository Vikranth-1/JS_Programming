You've learned about the HTMLMediaElement and MediaStreams APIs, but there are a few more APIs that can be quite helpful in working with video and audio.

The first is the Screen Capture API. As the name might suggest, this API allows you to record a user's screen. This API is exposed by calling the getDisplayMedia() method of the mediaDevices object and consuming the returned media stream.

Then there is the MediaStream Recording API. This API works in tandem with the MediaStreams APIs, allowing you to record a MediaStream (or even an HTMLMediaElement directly). It then fires dataavailable events with Blob payloads you can write to the local file storage.

Underlying all of this technology is the Media Source Extensions API. The Media Source Extensions API is what allows you to directly pass a user's webcam feed to a video element with the srcObject property, for example.

And finally, the Web Audio API which powers everything audible on the web. This API includes important objects like an AudioBuffer (representing a Buffer specifically containing audio data) or the AudioContext.

And that wraps up our lessons on audio and video!
