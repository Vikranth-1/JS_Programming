Let's learn about codecs and how they work.

If you have worked with videos or audio before, you may have heard about codecs. A codec, short for "encoder/decoder", is an algorithm or software that can convert audio and video between analogue and digital formats.

Codecs can be specified as part of the MIME type. The basic syntax to define a codec is to add a semi-colon after the media type, then codecs= and the codec.

For example, an OGG audio file which uses the Vorbis codec might have a MIME type of audio/ogg; codecs=vorbis. Or, if a file supports multiple codecs, you can specify them as comma separated, but must surround them with quotes: video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis".

But some file types have a much more complicated syntax for codecs. For example, an MP4 might have a codec of codecs="avc1.4d002a", indicating it was encoded with H.264.

But when might you actually use these? Well, you can include them in the type attribute for a source element. This allows you to specify different codecs for the same format, giving the browser more granular options when determining which format to use for that user's environment.

But you can also use them as part of the MIME type you pass to the global MediaSource.isTypeSupported() method. This method accepts a MIME-type, and returns true if the environment is likely to support it. Or rather, it returns false if it fails to instantiate a buffer for that file type. This approach allows you to programmatically select a source yourself, rather than relying on whatever the browser determines is "best".
