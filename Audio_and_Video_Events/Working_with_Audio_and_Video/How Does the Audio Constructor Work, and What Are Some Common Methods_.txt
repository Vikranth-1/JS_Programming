Let's learn about the Audio constructor and its common methods.

The Audio constructor, like other constructors, is a special function called with the new keyword. It returns an HTMLAudioElement, which you can then use to play audio for the user, or append to the DOM for the user to control themselves.

When you call the constructor, you can optionally pass a URL as the (only) argument. This URL should point to the source of the audio file you want to play. Or, if you need to change the source dynamically, you can assign the URL to the src property of the returned audio element.

The returned audio element offers various methods for controlling the audio. You'll most likely use the play() method, which begins audio playback. There is also the pause() method, which pauses the audio playback but preserves the current location in the track allowing play() to resume playback from that point.

You might expect there to be a stop() method, to pause audio playback and reset the track to the beginning. But instead, you should call pause() and set the currentTime property directly.

Finally, the canPlayType() method can be used to determine if a browser is likely to be able to play your specific audio format. You will learn about audio and video formats in the next lesson.
