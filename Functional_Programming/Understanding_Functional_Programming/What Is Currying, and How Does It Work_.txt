Currying is a technique where we transform a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

Let's start with a basic example. Imagine we have a function that adds two numbers:

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(3, 4)); // 7
This is a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Now, let's see how we can curry this function:

function curriedAdd(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(curriedAdd(3)(4)); // 7
In this curry converted code, instead of taking two arguments at once, we have a function that takes the first argument and returns another function. This returned function then takes the second argument and performs the addition. We call it like curriedAdd(3)(4), where each pair of parentheses represents a function call.

But why would we want to do this?

Currying allows us to create some special functions easily. For example, we could create a function that always adds five to any number:

function curriedAdd(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const addFive = curriedAdd(5);
console.log(addFive(10)); // 15
console.log(addFive(20)); // 25
Here, addFive is a function that's always ready to add five to whatever number we give it. This is a simple example of partial application, where we fix a certain number of arguments to a function, producing another function that takes fewer arguments.

While our examples have focused on functions with two arguments, currying can be applied to functions with any number of arguments.

As you continue your journey in JavaScript, you'll likely find many situations where currying can make your code cleaner and more expressive.
