In the previous lesson, we saw what the Fetch API is and how to use it. In this lesson, we will discuss about the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP methods of Fetch API.

Let's start with the most common HTTP method which is the GET method. This is used to retrieve data from a server. When you use fetch() without specifying a method, it defaults to GET.

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
In this code, we're making a GET request to https://api.example.com/data. Now, please note that you cannot use this data directly, you have to convert the response to a JSON format. Only then you can use it anywhere you want in your project. Here’s an example of how to do it:

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
In this code, the response coming from the Fetch API is a promise, and we are using a .then handler to convert the response to a JSON format. In a prior lesson, you learned that a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous process and its value.

The value of a promise is not known when the promise is created. It’s only known when the asynchronous process is completed. When we chain the two .then handlers to the fetch call, this is something called promise chaining which will be taught in the next lesson.

So far we have been retrieving resources from a server. But, did you know that we can also send data to the server? The POST method is used to send data to a server to create a resource. Here’s an example of a POST method which is used to create data into the server:

fetch('https://api.example.com/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  })
})
In this example, we're sending a POST request to create a new user. We specify the method as POST, set the appropriate headers, and include a body with the data we want to send. The body needs to be a string, so we use JSON.stringify() to convert our object to a JSON string.

The PUT method is used to update existing resources of a server. Here’s an example:

fetch('https://api.example.com/users/45', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Smith',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  })
})
In this example, look carefully at the URL, you can see a 45 at the end. This is typically used as a unique ID to identify the data we are trying to update. We used the PUT method on the code and also specified the data as the body which will be used to update the identified data.

The DELETE method is used to delete a resource from the server. Here’s an example:

fetch('https://api.example.com/users/45', {
  method: 'DELETE',
})
In this code, we are including the DELETE method and an ID at the end of the url to identify the data which needs to be deleted.
