As you learned in previous lessons, cookies are simple data that websites can store on a user's device.

However, you can actually store more complex data structures in cookies. One common method is to use JSON to store objects or arrays. Here's an example:

const userData = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  role: "admin"
};

document.cookie = "userInfo=" + JSON.stringify(userData) + "; path=/";
In this example, we're creating an object with user data, converting it to a JSON string, and then storing it in a cookie. When we want to retrieve this data, we can parse the JSON string into an object using JSON.parse().

Now, you might be wondering about the "HTTP headers" aspect of our topic. Typically, cookies are set by the server using HTTP headers.

For example, a server might send a header like this:

Set-Cookie: username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 31 Dec 2024 6:00:00 IST; path=/
This header tells the browser to set a cookie.

We can also set cookies directly in the browser using JavaScript. This is useful for storing data that doesn't need to be sent to the server immediately.

Please note that cookies have a size limit of around 4KB, and storing too much data in them may slow down your web app.

Storing large amounts of data in cookies can increase network traffic as cookies are sent with every HTTP request.
