In the previous lesson, we learned about working with localStorage and were briefly introduced to sessionStorage.

Recall, that sessionStorage is when the data is cleared as soon as the user closes the tab or window in which the web application is running. It’s ideal for situations where data only needs to persist for the length of a single session, such as maintaining form data during navigation or storing temporary state information during a checkout process.

Much like localStorage, sessionStorage uses key-value pairs to store and retrieve data. The methods used with sessionStorage are also the same as localStorage, with the only real difference being how long the data is stored.

Here are a few examples of working with the different methods:

sessionStorage.setItem(): Stores a key-value pair in sessionStorage.
sessionStorage.setItem('cart', '3 items');
sessionStorage.getItem(): Retrieves the value of a given key from sessionStorage.
let cart = sessionStorage.getItem('cart');
console.log(cart); // Outputs: '3 items'
sessionStorage.removeItem(): Removes a specific item from sessionStorage using its key.
sessionStorage.removeItem('cart');
sessionStorage.clear(): Clears all data stored in sessionStorage.
sessionStorage.clear();
Let’s look at an example where we store data in sessionStorage which only lasts as long as the browser tab or window is open:

// Store data in sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('currentUser', 'JohnDoe');

// Retrieve the stored data
const user = sessionStorage.getItem('currentUser');
console.log(user); // 'JohnDoe'

// Remove a specific key from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.removeItem('currentUser');

// Clear all sessionStorage data
sessionStorage.clear();
In this example, we:

Store the current user’s name (JohnDoe) in sessionStorage.

Retrieve and display it.

Remove the item associated with the key currentUser.

Clear all sessionStorage data.

The key difference from localStorage is that as soon as the user closes the tab, all stored session data will be lost.

sessionStorage is particularly useful in scenarios like:

Storing temporary data such as form entries during a multi-page form process.

Storing temporary selections or preferences that don’t need to persist across sessions.

Maintaining state on a single-page application that doesn’t need to be remembered once the tab is closed.

sessionStorage ensures that once the user leaves the page, the session data is cleared, which is great for scenarios where you don’t want to hold onto information beyond the current session.
