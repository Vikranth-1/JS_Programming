JavaScript is a language where things sometimes work in surprising, or even weird, ways. One such surprise occurs when you mix numbers and strings in calculations. The first thing you'll probably try is to add a number and a string. In JavaScript, the + operator does double duty. It handles both addition and string concatenation, which is a way to join two strings together.

When you use + with a number and a string, JavaScript decides to treat them both as strings and joins them together. If you check the type of the result with the typeof operator, you'd see it's indeed a string:

const result = 5 + '10';

console.log(result); // 510
console.log(typeof result); // string
What do you think will happen if you switch the order of 5 and '10'?

const result = '10' + 5;

console.log(result); // 105
console.log(typeof result); // string
You can see the same thing happened. JavaScript sees a string in '10' and a number in 5, so it converts the number to a string and concatenates them. This is known as type coercion. Type coercion is when a value from one data type is converted into another.

Things get more interesting when you try to perform other arithmetic operations like subtraction, multiplication, or division with a string and number. In these cases, JavaScript tries to convert the string into a number before doing the math – another type coercion! Here's what happens:

const subtractionResult = '10' - 5;
console.log(subtractionResult); // 5
console.log(typeof subtractionResult); // number

const multiplicationResult = '10' * 2;
console.log(multiplicationResult); // 20
console.log(typeof multiplicationResult); // number

const divisionResult = '20' / 2;
console.log(divisionResult); // 10
console.log(typeof divisionResult); // number
In the examples above, JavaScript successfully converts the string '10' or '20' to a number and then performs the calculation. As a result, '10' - 5 yields 5, '10' * 2 gives 20, and '20' / 2 results in 10.

But what if the string doesn't look like a number? Let's see what happens in that case:

const subtractionResult = 'abc' - 5;
console.log(subtractionResult); // NaN
console.log(typeof subtractionResult); // number

const multiplicationResult = 'abc' * 2;
console.log(multiplicationResult); // NaN
console.log(typeof multiplicationResult); // number

const divisionResult = 'abc' / 2;
console.log(divisionResult); // NaN
console.log(typeof divisionResult); // number
In the examples above, the string 'abc' does not represent a valid numeric value, so JavaScript cannot convert it into a meaningful number. When such conversion fails, JavaScript returns NaN, which stands for "Not a Number". NaN is a special value of the Number type that represents an invalid or unrepresentable number.

What if you perform arithmetic operations with a boolean (true or false)? Let's see what happens. JavaScript treats booleans as numbers in mathematical operations: true becomes 1, and false becomes 0.

const result1 = true + 1;
console.log(result1); // 2
console.log(typeof result1); // number

const result2 = false + 1;
console.log(result2); // 1
console.log(typeof result2); // number

const result3 = 'Hello' + true;
console.log(result3); // "Hellotrue"
console.log(typeof result3); // string
In the first two examples, true + 1 resulted in 2, and false + 1 resulted in 1. In the third example, 'Hello' + true, JavaScript converted true to a string and concatenates it with 'Hello', resulting in 'Hellotrue', which is a string.

For null and undefined, JavaScript treats null as 0 and undefined as NaN in mathematical operations:

const result1 = null + 5;
console.log(result1); // 5
console.log(typeof result1); // number

const result2 = undefined + 5;
console.log(result2); // NaN
console.log(typeof result2); // number
JavaScript often performs type coercion, automatically converting data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans in sometimes unexpected ways. Understanding these conversions is crucial for avoiding bugs and writing robust code in your projects.
