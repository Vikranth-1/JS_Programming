Conditional statements let you make decisions in your JavaScript code. They allow your program to flow in a particular way based on certain conditions. Let's take a look at how if, else if, else, and the ternary operator work to let you control the flow of your code.

An if statement takes a condition and runs a block of code if that condition is truthy. Truthy values are any values that result in true when evaluated in a Boolean context like an if statement. Here are examples of truthy values:

non-empty strings, for example, hello

any number other than 0 and -0, for example, 4, -5, and others

arrays

objects

the boolean true

On the other hand, falsy values are values that evaluate to false in a boolean context. JavaScript has few falsy values, which makes them easy to remember. Here are a few falsy values:

boolean false

0 (zero)

"" (empty string)

null

undefined

NaN (Not a Number)

Now, that we have a basic understanding of truthy and falsy values, let's see how it works with if statements. In this first example, we are using a couple of if statements to check against truthy and falsy values:

if (null) {
  console.log("This will not run.");
}

if ("freeCodeCamp") {
  console.log("This will run.");
}
Since null is a falsy value, the message inside the block will never be logged to the console. But for the second if statement, the string freeCodeCamp is a truthy value, and will be considered true in this boolean context of the if statement. As a result, the message This will run. will be logged to the console.

Let's take a look at a few more examples on how if statements work with different comparison operators. Here is an example of using an if statement to check if the user is eligible to vote:

const age = 22;

if (age >= 18) {
 console.log("You're eligible to vote"); // You're eligible to vote
}
In this example, since age is currently 22, this means the condition will evaluate to true because 22 is greater than or equal to 18. So the message You're eligible to vote will be logged to the console. If we change the example so age is now 15, then the condition will evaluate to false and the message will not be logged to the console:

const age = 15;

if (age >= 18) {
 console.log("You're eligible to vote"); // Code not running because age is less than 18
}
When a condition is false, then you can use an else clause:

const age = 15;

if (age >= 18) {
 console.log("You're eligible to vote");
} else {
 console.log("You're not eligible to vote"); // You're not eligible to vote
}
In this example, 15 is not greater than or equal to 18, so the condition would be false. The code inside the else block will run in this case.

If you want to check multiple conditions, you can use an else if block. This allows your program to choose between more than two paths.

const score = 87;

if (score >= 90) {
 console.log('You got an A'); 
} else if (score >= 80) {
 console.log('You got a B'); // You got a B
} else if (score >= 70) {
 console.log('You got a C');
} else {
 console.log('You failed! You need to study more!');
}
Since the score is currently 87, then the message of You got a B would be logged to the console.

The ternary operator is a compact way to write simple if/else statements. It has three parts: a condition, a result if the condition is true, and a result if it is false. Here's the basic syntax:

condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
Here's an example dealing with weather temperatures in Celsius:

const temperature = 30;
const weather = temperature > 25 ? 'sunny' : 'cool';

console.log(`It's a ${weather} day!`);
If temperature is greater than 25, the code above logs It's a sunny day!. If temperature is ever less than 25, it logs It's a cool day!.

So, which should you use between an if statement and a ternary? Use a ternary while dealing with a single condition or single expressions, or when you want a compact syntax for simple logic. Use if/else statements when you're dealing with complex conditions and multiple statements, as things become unreadable if you nest ternaries.
