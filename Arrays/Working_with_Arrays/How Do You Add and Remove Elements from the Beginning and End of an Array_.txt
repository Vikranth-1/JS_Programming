Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, which means you can easily add or remove elements from them. There are four main methods for adding and removing elements from the beginning and end of an array: push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift(). Let's explore each of these methods in detail.

The push() method is used to add one or more elements to the end of an array. The return value for the push() method is the new length of the array. Here's an example of adding a new fruit to the existing fruits array:

const fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
const newLength = fruits.push("orange");
console.log(newLength); // 3
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
In this example, we start with an array called fruits which contains two elements. We then use the push() method to add the string orange to the end of the array.

You might have noticed that we are using const when declaring the fruits array. But why is it possible to add more elements to this fruits array when fruits is a constant? This is possible because declaring an array with the const keyword creates a reference to the array. While the array itself is mutable and can be modified, you cannot reassign a new value to the fruits constant, like this:

const fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
fruits = ["This", "will", "not", "work"];
console.log(fruits); // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. 
The next method we will look at is the pop() method. The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. It also modifies the original array. Here's how it works:

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
let lastFruit = fruits.pop();
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana"]
console.log(lastFruit); // "orange"
In this example, we start with an array of three fruits. The pop() method removes the last element (orange) from the array and returns it. The original fruits array is modified and contains only two elements.

The unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns its new length. It works similarly to push(), but modifies the start of the array instead of the end. Here's an example:

let numbers = [2, 3];
let newLength = numbers.unshift(1);
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newLength); // 3
In this example, we use unshift() to add the number 1 to the beginning of the numbers array. The method returns the new length of the array, which is 3.

Finally, the shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that element. It's similar to pop(), but it works at the beginning of the array instead of the end. Here's how it works:

let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
let firstColor = colors.shift();
console.log(colors); // ["green", "blue"]
console.log(firstColor); // "red"
In this example, we start with an array of three colors. The shift() method removes the first element (red) from the array and returns it. The original colors array is modified to contain only two elements.

Note that while push() and unshift() can add multiple elements at once, pop() and shift() remove only one element at a time.
